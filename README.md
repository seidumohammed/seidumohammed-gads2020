## TRANSLATION CODE

## LAB-1: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine

## Objectives
   - In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

   - Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

   - Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

   - Connect between the two instances.

## Steps:

1.  Create a virtual machine using the GCP Console

   gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213"  --subnet "default" --tags http


    gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http --action=ALLOW --destination=INGRESS --rules=http:80 --target-tags=http

   

2.  Create a virtual machine using the gcloud command line

     gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b

    gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213"  --subnet "default"



3. Connect between two instances
   1. Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:

   - Connect to my-vm-2:
      gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2
   - Ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2
      ping c -4 my-vm-1

   - Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1:
      ssh my-vm-1

   - At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:

      sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y

   - Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:

      sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

   - Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:

      Hi from Seidu Mohammed

   - Press Ctrl+O and then press Enter to save your edited file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit the nano text   editor.

   - Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
   - 
      curl http://localhost/

   - Result: The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.

   - To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
  
      exit

   - To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:

      curl http://my-vm-1/

   - Result: The response will again be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.



## LAB-2: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

## Objectives:

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

 - Initialize App Engine.

 - Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

 - Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

 - Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

 ## Steps:

 1. Initialize App Engine:
    
    -  Initialize App Engine app with a project and choose its region:
    
        gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID --region=us-central1

    -  Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
    
        git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

    -  Navigate to the source directory:
    
        cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

2. Run Hello World application locally:

    -  Download and update the packages list:

        sudo apt-get update

    - Set up a python virtual environment in which the application will run:
     
        sudo apt-get install virtualenv -y
        
        virtualenv -p python3 venv

    - Activate the virtual environment
        
        source venv/bin/activate

    - Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies
        
        pip install  -r requirements.txt

    - To run the application:
        
        python main.py

3. Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine:

    - Navigate to the source directory:
    
        cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

    - Deploy your Hello World application:
    
        gcloud app deploy

        - If prompted enter y

    - Launch your browser to view the app at http://http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com.appspot.com
        
        gcloud app browse

    -Result: Displays Hello World in  the browser

4. Disable the application:

     gcloud app versions stop 20200910t135648

  - Note: Auto-scaling has to be disabled



## Lab-3: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with GKE

## Objectives:

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

 - Provision a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine.

 - Deploy and manage Docker containers using kubectl.

 ## Steps:

1. Confirm that needed APIs are enabled.
    
    - Use the gcloud services command to confirm that both the Kubernetes Engine API and the Containers Registry API are enabled:

        gcloud services list --enabled
    
    Result: The Kubernetes Engine API and Containers Registry API are enabled.


2. Start a Kubernetes Engine cluster.

    - Assign your Qwiklabs zone to an environment variable called MY_ZONE:

        export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a
    
    - Start a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubernetes Engine. Name the cluster webfrontend and configure it to run 2 nodes:

        gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2

    - After the cluster is created, check your installed version of Kubernetes using the kubectl version command:

        kubectl version

3. Run and deploy a container.

    - Launch a single instance of the nginx container:

        kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10

    - View the pod running the nginx container:

        kubectl get pods

    - Expose the nginx container to the Internet:

        kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer

    - View the new service:

        kubectl get services

        - Result: The external IP address to view your webserver's home page.

    - Scale up the number of pods running on your service:

        kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3

    - Confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods:

        kubectl get pods

    - Confirm that your external IP address has not changed:

        kubectl get services

        - Result: The nginx server is still running. Therefore the external IP address is unchanged.
